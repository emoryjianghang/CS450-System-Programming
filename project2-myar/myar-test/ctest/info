1. check mesmie: it works, use 0 instead of \0 maybe
2. check how strncpy works: it does not guarantee a null terminator while strcpy does not promise enough space on the dest ptr side. abort 6 error
3. implement x using the test code: I finished delete instead; I will focus on x later (Tuesday probably)
4. print a string without ending \0
5. Lesson: ALWAYS start with minimal example

LATER THIS WEEK:

1. rewrite every single piece of this hw later on Tuesday
2. delete the current hw on the lab 
3. remember to add unlink to the delete method
